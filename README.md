## MMORPG Kit Snippets
Utility scripts and components for the everyman.
Developed for:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/mmorpg-kit-2d-3d-survival-110188


### Getting Started
- In your Assets folder (In CLI) do either:
    - `git clone git@github.com:jwhenry3/mmorpg-kit-snippets.git`
    - `git clone https://github.com/jwhenry3/mmorpg-kit-snippets.git`

### Flexible Spawners
The purpose of these scripts are to allow you to spawn harvestables and monsters on verying levels of your scene.
The default detection distance was too great to allow putting spawners underground, so this fine tunes 
the business rules behind it.
#### Instructions
- Replace any existing spawner components with the flexible versions to leverage the change
### Overhead UI
The purpose of these scripts are to improve the rendering and behavior of Overhead UI.
#### Instructions

    - CanvasOwningCharacterUI
    - CanvasNonOwningCharacterUI
    - CanvasMonsterCharacterUI
    - CanvasNPCU
- Configure the parameters of the scripts to meet your needs
- Watch the magic!
