### Tooltips

#### Instructions
- Drag the TooltipConfig prefab onto your CanvasGameplay
- Add TooltipArea to GameObjects with the UICharacterItem or UICharacterSkill script
- For equipment currently equipped, put the TooltipArea on the EquipSlot game objects (the nested UIItemIcon does not work)
- I have included several prefabs to see how its added
- The tooltips will appear either to the left or right of the element based on the distance from the side of the screen
- The tooltips will appear higher or lower on the screen based on if the tooltip will be fully seen in the screen
